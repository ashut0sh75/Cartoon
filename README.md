# Cartoonify Project

Welcome to the Cartoonify project! This project uses a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model to convert images into their cartoon form. Currently, three ML models are available in the formats of Dr, Fp16, and INT8. Users have the flexibility to customize the code to use their preferred model or even contribute their own.

If you're excited about this project, we invite you to contribute. Please follow the guidelines outlined below.
